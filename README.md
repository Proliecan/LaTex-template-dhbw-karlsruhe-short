# LaTex-Template for short and fast Documents
This Template is intended for very short documents such as homework, that still should be formatted properly.

It is
+ short
+ lightweight
+ in one file (except DHBW-logo)
+ easily understandable
+ compiling really fast
+ enabeling to get done with your work faster than using wysiwyg-office programs (such as libre office and ms word)

### I still wanted to include nice packages:
  |||
  -|-
  `graphix` | insert pictures
 `hyperref` | clickable links
 `listings` | code formatting
