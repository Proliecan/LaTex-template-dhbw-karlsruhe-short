# LaTex-Template for short and fast Documents
This Template is intended for very short documents such as homework, that still should be formatted properly.


## Setup-Guide:
Follow this link to: [gist.github.com/proliecan/...](https://gist.github.com/Proliecan/eb2ebea8084af4d211fe4d9f57fa1516)
 
 ## HOW TO USE
 1. Copy the Logo to your directory.
 2. Make a sub-directory for any seperate document you want to create.
 3. Copy the "template.tex" to the subdirectory.
 4. Fill in your information & title.
 5. Type your content & you're done!


## General Information:
It is
+ short
+ lightweight
+ in one file (except DHBW-logo)
+ easily understandable
+ compiling really fast
+ enabeling to get done with your work faster than using wysiwyg-office programs  
  (such as libre office and ms word)

### I still wanted to include nice packages:
  |||
  -|-
  `graphix` | insert pictures
 `hyperref` | clickable links
 `listings` | code formatting
